# User_Risk_Management

Creating a machine learning integrated app in Finanace Technology which will track the financial status of a user by generating a report or user financial protfolio on the basis of initial investments made by the user, type of investment, amount invested, current valuation, profit/loss and income level of the user.
By using these parameters we are predicting the risk tolerance level on the basis of which the loan will be generated for the user with the help of our AI enabled chatbot which will efficiently carry out the tasks of alerting the users of low risk tolerance and guiding the users having high risk tolerance for generating loan through our app.
